# SD-Homelessness-Program-Analysis
## Data Cleaning
We worked with `CityExpendituresRaw.csv` which had list of all programs in San Diego county which affect homelessness.
We cleaned the program names for aggregating first by setting all names to lower-case, replacing all dashed ("-") with spaces (" "), 
and changing all program names to match those which contained within the whole string, part of a string to another program name.
More complexe cleaning was done after that as well as some minor manual cleaning.
